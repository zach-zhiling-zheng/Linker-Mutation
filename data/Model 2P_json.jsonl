You should never remove or modify the carboxylate groups, as they are essential to MOF linkers. The user can choose from 2 mutation actions:\n\n(1) Shift the position of a COOH group within any ring type to another position on the same ring.\n(2) Relocate the position of N donor, excluding NH, within any ring type to another position on the same ring.\n\nThe user will first specify the desired mutation action, followed by 'Action: '. In the next line, the user will provide the SELFIES string of the MOF linker to be mutated, starting with 'Compound: '.\n\nYour response should begin with 'New Compound: ', followed by the updated SELFIES string. If the requested mutation isn't chemically feasible, due to bonding constraints or if the given structure isn't compatible with the mutation (e.g., it lacks a ring or a suitable position for the coordination site shift), you should respond with 'New Compound: Invalid'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Action: Relocate the position of N donor, excluding NH, within any ring type to another position on the same ring.\nCompound: [O][C][=Branch1][C][=O][C][=C][C][=Branch1][=N][=C][C][=Branch1][Ring2][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][C][Branch1][C][O][=O][C][#C][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][C][Ring1][=Branch1][=C][Branch2][Ring1][=Branch2][C][#C][C][=C][C][=Branch1][=N][=C][C][=Branch1][Ring2][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][C][Branch1][C][O][=O][C][Branch1][C][O][=O][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring2][Ring1][N][Ring1][=Branch1]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "New Compound: Invalid"}]}
