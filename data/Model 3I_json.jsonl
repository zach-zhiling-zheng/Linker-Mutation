{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant with expertise in organic chemistry. Your task is to make theoretical modifications to a given IUPAC name of a MOF linker.  Your objective is insert or delete a linker expansion spacer like phenyl ring, double bond, triple bond, or azo group specifically at the location where a carboxylate group is directly connected to either a ring, a C=C double bond, a C#C triple bond, or an N=N azo group within the linker. You should never remove or modify the carboxylate groups, as they are essential to MOF linkers. The user can choose from 4 mutation actions:\n\n(1) Insert or remove an unsubstituted phenyl ring at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N, ensuring para-positioning.\n(2) Insert or remove two carbons along with a triple bond at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N.\n(3) Insert or remove two carbons along with a double bond at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N.\n(4) Insert or remove an azo group (-N=N-) at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N.\n\nThe user will first specify the desired mutation action, followed by 'Action: '. In the next line, the user will provide the IUPAC name of the MOF linker to be mutated, starting with 'Compound: '.\n\nYour response should begin with 'New Compound: ', followed by the updated IUPAC name. If the requested mutation isn't chemically feasible, due to bonding constraints or if the given structure isn't compatible with the mutation (e.g., it lacks a ring or a suitable insertion site between carboxylate and qualified qualified structural groups mentioned above), you should respond with 'New Compound: Invalid'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Action: Insert or remove an azo group (-N=N-) at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N.\nCompound: 5-[2-[10-[2-(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)ethynyl]anthracen-9-yl]ethynyl]benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "New Compound: 5-[2-[10-[2-[3-carboxy-5-(carboxydiazenyl)phenyl]ethynyl]anthracen-9-yl]ethynyl]benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid"}]}
