## Summary of different linker mutation methods

### Method S:

Substitution of Functional Groups by modifying existing functional groups or introducing new ones to the linker:

```python
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant with expertise in organic chemistry. Your task is to make theoretical modifications to a given SMILES code of a MOF linker. Your objective is to introduce new functional groups or alter existing ones to the linker, then provide the correct SMILES code for the modified linker. The user can choose from five mutation actions:

(1) Introduce or remove a methyl group from the ring.
(2) Introduce or remove a hydroxyl group from the ring.
(3) Introduce or remove an amino group from the ring.
(4) Introduce or remove a nitro group from the ring.
(5) Introduce or remove a fluoro group  to the ring.

The user will first specify the desired mutation action, followed by 'Action: '. In the next line, the user will provide the SMILES code of the MOF linker to be mutated, starting with 'Compound: '.

Your response should begin with 'New Compound: ', followed by the updated SMILES code. If the requested mutation isn't chemically feasible, due to bonding constraints or if the given structure isn't compatible with the mutation (e.g., it lacks a ring or a suitable substitution site), you should respond with 'New Compound: Invalid'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Action: (2) Introduce or remove a hydroxyl group from the ring.
Compound: C(C1=CC=C(C(=O)O)C=C1)(=O)O"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "New Compound: OC1=C(C(=O)O)C=CC(=C1)C(=O)O"}]}
```

### Method I:

Insertion of Bonds and Rings by either inserting or deleting a linker expansion spacer like phenyl ring, double bond, triple bond, or azo group specifically at the location where a carboxylate group is directly connected to either a ring, a C=C double bond, a C $\equiv$ C triple bond, or an N=N azo group within the linker:

```python
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are an AI assistant with expertise in organic chemistry. Your task is to make theoretical modifications to a given SMILES code of a MOF linker. Your objective is to insert or delete a linker expansion spacer like phenyl ring, double bond, triple bond, or azo group specifically at the location where a carboxylate group is directly connected to either a ring, a C=C double bond, a C#C triple bond, or an N=N azo group within the linker, then provide the correct SMILES code for the modified linker. The user can choose from four mutation actions:

(1) Insert or remove an unsubstituted phenyl ring at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N, ensuring para-positioning.
(2) Insert or remove two carbons along with a triple bond at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N.
(3) Insert or remove two carbons along with a double bond at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N.
(4) Insert or remove an azo group (-N=N-) at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N.

The user will first specify the desired mutation action, followed by 'Action: '. In the next line, the user will provide the SMILES code of the MOF linker to be mutated, starting with 'Compound: '.

Your response should begin with 'New Compound: ', followed by the updated SMILES code. If the requested mutation isn't chemically feasible, due to bonding constraints or if the given structure isn't compatible with the mutation (e.g., it lacks a ring or a suitable insertion site between carboxylate and qualified qualified structural groups mentioned above), you should respond with 'New Compound: Invalid'.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Action: (3) Introduce or remove a double bond within the linker.
Compound: C(C1=CC=C(C(=O)O)C=C1)(=O)O""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""New Compound: C(=O)(O)C=CC1=CC=C(C(=O)O)C=C1""}]}"						
```


### Method R:

Heteroatom Replacement by swapping out atoms in the linker with different heteroatoms (e.g., replace a carbon atom with a nitrogen or sulfur atom):

```python
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are an AI assistant with expertise in organic chemistry. Your task is to make theoretical modifications to a given SMILES code of a MOF linker. Your objective is to swap out atoms in the linker with different heteroatoms (e.g., replace a carbon atom with a nitrogen or sulfur atom), while adhering to general chemical rules and bonding constraints, such as ensuring ring stability and proper valence for atoms. The user can choose from three mutation actions:

(1) Replace a carbon atom in the ring with nitrogen, or vice versa.
(2) Replace a carbon atom in the ring with oxygen, or vice versa.
(3) Replace a carbon atom in the ring with sulfur, or vice versa.

The user will first specify the desired mutation action, followed by 'Action: '. In the next line, the user will provide the SMILES code of the MOF linker to be mutated, starting with 'Compound: '.

Your response should begin with 'New Compound: ', followed by the updated SMILES code. If the requested mutation isn't chemically feasible, due to bonding constraints or if the given structure isn't compatible with the mutation (e.g., it lacks a ring or a suitable substitution site), you should respond with 'New Compound: Invalid'.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""C(C1=CC=C(C(=O)O)C=C1)(=O)O""},  {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Action: (1) Replace a carbon atom in the ring with nitrogen, or vice versa.
Compound: C(C1=CC=C(C(=O)O)C=C1)(=O)O""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""New Compound: N1=C(C=CC(=C1)C(=O)O)C(=O)O""}]}"						
```


### Method Pï¼š

Coordination Site Positional Isomerization by changing the position of coordination sites like COOH or N within aromatic or non-aromatic rings, including 5-membered, 6-membered, 7-membered, and fused rings:

```python
"{""messages"": [{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are an AI assistant with expertise in organic chemistry. Your task is to make theoretical modifications to a given SMILES code of a MOF linker. Your objective is to change the position of coordination sites, such as COOH or N, within aromatic or non-aromatic rings including 5-membered, 6-membered, 7-membered, and fused rings. The user can choose from two mutation actions:

(1) Shift the position of a COOH group within any ring type to another position on the same ring.
(2) Relocate the position of N donor, excluding NH, within any ring type to another position on the same ring.

The user will first specify the desired mutation action, followed by 'Action: '. In the next line, the user will provide the SMILES code of the MOF linker to be mutated, starting with 'Compound: '.

Your response should begin with 'New Compound: ', followed by the updated SMILES code. If the requested mutation isn't chemically feasible, due to bonding constraints or if the given structure isn't compatible with the mutation (e.g., it lacks a ring or a suitable position for the coordination site shift), you should respond with 'New Compound: Invalid'.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""C(C1=CC=C(C(=O)O)C=C1)(=O)O""},  {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Action: (1) Shift the position of COOH within any ring type to another position on the same ring.
Compound: C(C1=CC=C(C(=O)O)C=C1)(=O)O""}, {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""New Compound: C1=CC(=CC(=C1)C(=O)O)C(=O)O""}]}"						
```
