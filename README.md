# Linker-Mutation

| Mutation Method | Description | Consequence | Action 1 | Action 2 | Action 3 | Action 4 | Action 5 |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Method S | Substitution of Functional Groups | Modify existing functional groups or introduce new ones to the linker. This can influence the MOF's interaction with guest molecules. | Introduce or remove a methyl group to the ring | Introduce or remove a hydroxyl group to the ring | Introduce or remove an amino group to the ring | Introduce or remove a nitro group to the ring | Introduce or remove a fluoro group to the ring |
| Method I | Insertion of Bonds and Rings | Insert or delete a linker expansion spacer like phenyl ring, double bond, triple bond, or azo group specifically at the location where a carboxylate group is directly connected to either a ring, a C=C double bond, a C#C triple bond, or an N=N azo group within the linker. This can alter the electronic properties, flexibility, and stability. | Insert or remove an unsubstituted phenyl ring at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N, ensuring para-positioning | Insert or remove two carbons along with a triple bond at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N | Insert or remove two carbons along with a double bond at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N | Insert or remove an azo group (-N=N-) at the connection where the carboxylate group is directly attached to either a ring, C=C, C#C, or N=N | / |
| Method R | Heteroatom Replacement | Swap out atoms in the linker with different heteroatoms (e.g., replace a carbon atom with a nitrogen or sulfur atom). This can introduce new electronic properties or bonding motifs. | Replace a carbon atom in the ring with nitrogen, or vice versa | Replace a carbon atom in the ring with oxygen, or vice versa | Replace a carbon atom in the ring with sulfur, or vice versa | / | / |
| Method P | Coordination Site Positional Isomerization | Change the position of coordination sites like COOH or N within aromatic or non-aromatic rings, including 5-membered, 6-membered, 7-membered, and fused rings. This can modify the topology and geometry of the resulting MOF, influencing its properties. | Shift the position of a COOH group within any ring type to another position on the same ring | Relocate the position of N donor, excluding NH, within any ring type to another position on the same ring | / | / | / |
